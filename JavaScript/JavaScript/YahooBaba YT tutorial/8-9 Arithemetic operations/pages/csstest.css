/* Syntax of 'animation' shorthand version;  */
/* animation:[name] [duration] [timing-function] [delay] [iteration-count] [direction] [fill-mode] [play-state] */

/* [name] or animatino-name- name of the @ function */

/* [duration] or animation-duration- Duration of the function usually in seconds "s"*/

/* [timing-function] or animation-timing-funcion- Sets how an animation progresses though each duration of each cycle 
  Keyword values:
  ease (starts slow speeds up then ends slow)
  ease-in (starts slow then speeds up)
  ease-out (starts normally then slows down)
  ease-in-out (similar to ease)
  linear (constant speed)
  step-start (
  step-end
  cubic-bezier(w,x,y,z)- wxyz, we can make our own curve and control acceleration and decceleration. 
                         for best experience use 'cubic-bezier generator'on google                         
*/

/* [delay] or animation-delay - Normal delay at the beginning */

/* [iteration-count] or aniamtion-iteration-count - number of times that animation repeats, we can specify this as infinite */

/* [direction] or animation-direction - direction of the animation
   keywords:
   - normal (default)
   - reverse
   - alternate (goes normal then reverses)
   - alternate-reverse (opposite directions of alternate)

*/

/* [fill-mode] or animtion-fill-mode - controls how the element looks after its animation finishes
    keyword: 
    - forwards - last frame of the animation is how the element looks after the animation finishes
*/

/* [play-state] or animation-play-state - controls whether the animation is played or paused. */
a:hover{
  animation: animate 9s linear infinite;  /* This calls the "animate" (keyframe) 'class' down below!
  This is why we have written 'animate' in the beginning on this property  */
} 



/* Best things to animate is position, scale, rotation and opacity in CSS */
/* IF we animate anything else then we may not have 60fps which is undesirable */

/* How to trigger? */
/* We can have either Hover pseudo class or class changes */
