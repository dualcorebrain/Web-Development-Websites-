FlexBox is an alternative to CSS Float.
Float only gives us Horizontal position, whereas Flexbox gives us full control. Float was mainly made for 'magazine' styled layouts

We should use Flexbox completely and only rely on floats for text to flow around a box.

Flex container looks at the whole container whereas flex items looks at individual elements within the container

Think of Flexbox and CSS in general as boxes within boxes 
Use of Flexbox is entire nested boxes within each other

Everything in CSS is defaultly rendered with CSS's box model. But display:flex tells CSS donts use the 
box model instead use Flexbox instead.


justify-content: center; Important look this up on the website and the CSS Flexbox cheat sheet
Similar to 'margin: 0 auto' however notice rather than focusing on individual element we simply
did that to the container. This is a commmon theme in CSS
